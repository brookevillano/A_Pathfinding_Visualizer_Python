# A* Pathfinding Visualization

This project is a visual representation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm using Pygame. The A* Algorithm is widely used in graph traversal and pathfinding due to its performance and accuracy. This visualization tool allows users to interactively place start and end points, obstacles, and visualize the pathfinding process.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to add start and end points, as well as barriers.
- **Path Visualization**: See the algorithm in action finding the shortest path.
- **Customizable Grid**: Easily reset the grid to start a new pathfinding visualization.

## Instructions

- **Left Click**: Add a starting point (orange dot), ending point (blue dot), and barriers (black dots).
- **Right Click**: Clear a cell.
- **SPACE**: Run the algorithm and visualize the pathfinding process.
- **C**: Clear the screen and start over.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Pygame:
